        <h2 class=" font-semibold mt-40  mb-8 border-2 border-neutral-50 p-4"><em>Ques-1:What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</em> </h2>
        <p class=" ml-8 text-gray-800">Ans: <br> Dom stands for "Document Object Model", it defines the way how a document is
            accessed and manipulated.It is a language independent model for representing and interacting with objects in
            HTML.</p>
        <h2 class=" font-semibold my-8 border-2 border-neutral-50 p-4">Ques-2:How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM
            methods.</h2>
        <p class=" ml-8 text-gray-800">Ans: <br>By using JavaScript I can select and change HTML elements using DOM.  <br> The
            methods are as follows:
            <br>
            1)getElementsByTagName() <br>
            2)getElementsByClassName() <br>
            3)getElementById() <br>
            4)querySelector() <br>
            5)querySelectorAll()
        </p>
        <h2 class=" font-semibold my-8 border-2 border-neutral-50 p-4 ">Ques-3: What is event bubble?</h2>
        <p class=" ml-8 text-gray-800">Ans: <br> Event Bubble is a Feature of DOM, where a event is done on an element and it
            propagates up in the DOM
            tree to all the parent elements. An event that occurs on an element is initially handled by the element
            before it bubbles up to its parent elements in the DOM tree.</p>
        <h2 class=" font-semibold my-8 border-2 border-neutral-50 p-4">Ques-4:What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h2>
        <p class=" ml-8 text-gray-800">Ans:<br> Call back function is the function that is passed as an argument to another
            function, and it is executed
            when the original function is done working. <br>
            call back functions are used because many JavaScript actions are asynchronous. Let say we need a function
            when someone presses the button, callback function will execute only when the button is clicked or the event
            is done. This events can be user generated, mouse click,mouse enter,keypress etc etc. it allows us to
            continue executing code while the operation is being executed in the background.</p>
